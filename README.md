## Java Sockets

***Socket programming*** refers to writing programs that execute across multiple computers in which the devices are all connected to each other using a network.

There are two communication protocols that we can use for socket programming: ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)*** and ***Transfer Control Protocol (TCP).***

***UDP*** is connection-less, meaning there's no session between the client and the server.

***TCP*** is connection-oriented, meaning an exclusive connection must first be established between the client and server for communication to take place.

Java provides a collection of classes and interfaces that take care of low-level communication details between the client and server.
